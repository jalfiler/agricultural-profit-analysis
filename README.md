# Agricultural Profits in Ghana
Objective

The ACME corporation is considering moving into agricultural inputs in Ghana. To get an idea of whom to target for their sales efforts they have hired you to analyze what determines agricultural profit there. They are especially interested in what effect household educational attainment and the characteristics of the local area has on profit, but if you find other results of interest, they would like to hear those as well. They have left the choice of explanatory variables and variable definitions to you, but to be able to compare across regions they want at least one specification that examines profit per area unit (for example, acre, hectare, or square meters). 


Analysis

ACME has provided you with access to the Ghana Living Standard Survey 4 from 1998/99, including all the documentation that comes with the survey. The data files are in Stata format and contain the raw data from Ghana Statistical Service, so expect a fair number of data issues. Not all the data are equally relevant to your work.

You can find a zip file with all the data and the associated documentation here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/09ih1cqjv0vw6aa/glss4_new.zip?dl=0). Make sure you read the documentation before even looking at the data. Note that some of the data are calculated aggregates from a report put out by the World Bank. You can use these as well. Documentation for the aggregates is also provided.
